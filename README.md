# Lost Ark LFG manager

Managing guild in games can be quite handful, therefore this app was created to help guild leaders plan out upcoming raids and guild events.

Note that only our guildmates are given permission to use the application. If you wish to use this app for your guild, you need to setup your own backend and hosting service. My project uses Firebase Realtime Database, Authentication and Hosting.
